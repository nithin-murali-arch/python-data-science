# Data Science Basics

## Types of Data

### Numerical
Mades up of quantifiable data. Eg: Stock prices, etc.

#### Discrete

Not Fraction. Eg. Jack purchased 4 chocolates. I purchased 10.22 liters of petrol.

#### Continous Data

Could have inifinite possible values. Eg. Rainfall in a region

### Categorical

No mathematical meaning.

Gender / Yes/No / Race - Used to categorise.

Can assign numbers to data. But shouldn't have numerical meaning.

### Ordinal

Mixture of numerical and categorical data. Eg: Movie * rating.

## Statistics

Following only works with discrete values.

### Mean

Average - Sum/(number of values)

### Median

Sort data set and pick middle record. If even number of records average of middle 2 records

Mean is skewed by a few people - Average income of mean is higher than median

### Mode

Most common value in data set.

## Standard Deviation and Variance

### Standard Deviation

σ(Sigma) is standard deviation and its value is the square root of variance.

If a data set is outside the standard deviation it is an outliar.

### Population Variance (Google for formula)

Variance is denoted by σ^2(Sigma squared)

It is the average of squared differences from the mean.

Eg.

(1, 4, 5, 4, 8)

Mean = 4.4

(-3.4, -0.4, 0.6, -0.4, 3.6)    //(X)

(^Square that)

Mean of that ^

### Sample Variance (Google for formula)

Get average with denominator as len(array)-1 at point (X)

## Probability Density Function

Probability of a data point falling within a given range of given value.

## Probability Mass Function

probability of discrete values occuring in a data set.
